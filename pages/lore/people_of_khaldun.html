                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Of the three general groups the people of Khald&ucircn can be divided into, 
                            the Ceyah are those who are neutral in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>. The initial Ceyah were those who did not follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>;
                            generally, those who followed <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Akrua">Akrua</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Pyrus">Pyrus</a>,
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ornella">Ornella</a> refused to partake in the struggle. It became evident that there were some who followed the
                            gods involved in the war that also did not want to fight. They joined the Ceyah, and after a hard-fought war, won their freedom. They retreated from the main three continents, 
                            <a href="/pages/landmasses/danmeny.html">Danmeny</a>, <a href="/pages/landmasses/eaplas.html">Eaplas</a>, and <a href="/pages/landmasses/istira.html">Istira</a>,
                            settling on the relatively uninhabited larger islands and island chains around the plane.<br><br>

                            Once, during the <a href="/pages/references.html#Ceyah_Rebellion">Ceyah Rebellion</a>, the Ceyah were a united people. Their attempt to escape the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>
                            united them. After they won, there was not a common thread throughout every Ceyah individual. Among them, there were worshippers to every <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Greater_Dieties">Greater Deity</a>, as well as
                            worshippers for many of the <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties</a>. Since then, they have fractured, broken apart into many different groups and nations across their lands. Some sects 
                            of the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a> have attempted to use this disunity to conquer some Ceyah groups, to a varying degree
                            of success. More generally, the Ceyah end up living away from the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, with their only interaction
                            being between diplomatic dignitaries and traders. <br><br>

                            Even though the idea of a united Ceyah no longer exists, there still are a number cultural similarities between many, if not all, of the Ceyah. Many believe in some sort
                            of religious freedom. As such, there is no one enforced diety, or even pantheon of dieties, that is enforced across the Ceyah. Despite the vast majority of the Ceyah believing
                            in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a>, there are some agnostic and atheistic Ceyah. Because of their cultural similarities,
                            many Ceyah innately trust other Ceyah much more than they would a <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> individual or a <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            person. Because of this, both business and personal relationships between Ceyah and the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            are fragile, and break easily. 
                            </p>

                            <p>By the time they had won their freedom, there were 12 members who had risen above the ranks, and were known on all three sides of the conflict. In fact,
                            among Ceyah culture, they have been raised as heroes, almost revered as <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties.

                                    She herself was reluctant, but followed her orders. She joined the Ceyah, and was able to counter many of the beasts sent forth by the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>; Astarte called
                                    and conjured many animals from the forest to help the Ceyah. Many times, these new allies turned the tide of the battle. After the war, she retired to the northeasternmost
                                    islands in the plane, back into the forests from which she came. These forest islands, as the home of a legendary figure, became culturally significant to the Ceyah, and were

                                        to improve the lifestyle of his tribe. One day, after the outbreak of the war, Belphegor was returning home after a meeting with the local goblinoid tribes - something
                                        that had never happened before. He returned to see his tribe dead, with no clear sign as to the killers. After following the tracks, Belphegor discovered that one of the 
                                        neighboring Orc tribes had murdered his family. He did some talking, and found out that the tribe were contract killers, who had worked for both the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>. 
                                        Belphegor turned from both <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, and joined the Ceyah in their war. His charisma and direct line of communication to the gods won respect throughout the Ceyah,
                                        earning him recognition unheard of for a hobgoblin. After the Ceyah won their freedom, Belphegor disappeared. It is suspected he continued fighting until his death, but no one knows for certain.

                            as a single broad entity, sprawling across Khald&ucircn, that is not the case. There are three subcategories of the Kohan: the Royalists, the Nationalists, and the Council, each of which

                            <h4>The Royalists</h4>
                            <p>The Royalists are the subcategory of the Kohan that fight because their ruler ordered them to do so. The heroes of these people are all great political or religious leaders,

                            <p>The Nationalists are the Kohan who fight to bring about a united people, one people under Uesis. In their image, there would be no need for kingdoms or democracies, with the exception
                            of the single united people of Khald&ucircn, with Uesis as their main group. Generally speaking, many Uesis' zealots form the ranks of the Nationalists.

                            <p>The Council are the Kohan who fight against the Fallen because they believe that it is the right thing to do. In their eyes, the creations of Ahriman are disgusting, unearthly creatures
                            that never should have been made. Their creation, meant to murder humanoids who disrespect the land, was an injustice, and as such, the Council have set out to right said injustice.

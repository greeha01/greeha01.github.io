                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Of the three general groups the people of Khald&ucircn can be divided into, 
                            the Ceyah are those who are neutral in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>. The initial Ceyah were those who did not follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>;
                            generally, those who followed <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Akrua">Akrua</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Pyrus">Pyrus</a>,
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ornella">Ornella</a> refused to partake in the struggle. It became evident that there were some who followed the
                            gods involved in the war that also did not want to fight. They joined the Ceyah, and after a hard-fought war, won their freedom. They retreated from the main three continents, 
                            <a href="/pages/landmasses/danmeny.html">Danmeny</a>, <a href="/pages/landmasses/eaplas.html">Eaplas</a>, and <a href="/pages/landmasses/istira.html">Istira</a>,
                            settling on the relatively uninhabited larger islands and island chains around the plane.<br><br>

                            Once, during the <a href="/pages/references.html#Ceyah_Rebellion">Ceyah Rebellion</a>, the Ceyah were a united people. Their attempt to escape the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>
                            united them. After they won, there was not a common thread throughout every Ceyah individual. Among them, there were worshippers to every <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Greater_Dieties">Greater Deity</a>, as well as
                            worshippers for many of the <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties</a>. Since then, they have fractured, broken apart into many different groups and nations across their lands. Some sects 
                            of the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a> have attempted to use this disunity to conquer some Ceyah groups, to a varying degree
                            of success. More generally, the Ceyah end up living away from the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, with their only interaction
                            being between diplomatic dignitaries and traders. <br><br>

                            Even though the idea of a united Ceyah no longer exists, there still are a number cultural similarities between many, if not all, of the Ceyah. Many believe in some sort
                            of religious freedom. As such, there is no one enforced diety, or even pantheon of dieties, that is enforced across the Ceyah. Despite the vast majority of the Ceyah believing
                            in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a>, there are some agnostic and atheistic Ceyah. Because of their cultural similarities,
                            many Ceyah innately trust other Ceyah much more than they would a <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> individual or a <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            person. Because of this, both business and personal relationships between Ceyah and the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            are fragile, and break easily. 
                            </p>

                            <p>By the time they had won their freedom, there were 12 members who had risen above the ranks, and were known on all three sides of the conflict. In fact,
                            among Ceyah culture, they have been raised as heroes, almost revered as <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties.

                                    She herself was reluctant, but followed her orders. She joined the Ceyah, and was able to counter many of the beasts sent forth by the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>; Astarte called
                                    and conjured many animals from the forest to help the Ceyah. Many times, these new allies turned the tide of the battle. After the war, she retired to the northeasternmost
                                    islands in the plane, back into the forests from which she came. These forest islands, as the home of a legendary figure, became culturally significant to the Ceyah, and were

                                        to improve the lifestyle of his tribe. One day, after the outbreak of the war, Belphegor was returning home after a meeting with the local goblinoid tribes - something
                                        that had never happened before. He returned to see his tribe dead, with no clear sign as to the killers. After following the tracks, Belphegor discovered that one of the 
                                        neighboring Orc tribes had murdered his family. He did some talking, and found out that the tribe were contract killers, who had worked for both the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>. 
                                        Belphegor turned from both <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, and joined the Ceyah in their war. His charisma and direct line of communication to the gods won respect throughout the Ceyah,
                                        earning him recognition unheard of for a hobgoblin. After the Ceyah won their freedom, Belphegor disappeared. It is suspected he continued fighting until his death, but no one knows for certain.

                                    Of his hundreds of operations, he only made one mistake: in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Battle_of_Northista">Battle of Northista</a> (<a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> vs Ceyah), he over extended his battle lines, and the center broke.

                                    the secrets of draining one's life using just her staff. She was able to extract her enemies life, and used that energy to bestow strength upon the troops under her

                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Of the three general cultures of the peoples of Khald&ucircn, the Kohan are those who primarily worship <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a>. 
                            However, those who have been wronged by the Fallen in some way, or hate <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>'s creations also may be part of the Kohan.
                            In a broad sense, the Kohan are those who oppose <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> and his followers; those who reject the idea that Uesis is a god blinded by his ego and status. This
                            puts them at odds with the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, and makes them belligerents in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>, the struggle
                            between <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> that has plagued Khald&ucircn for millenia. However, despite the "Eternal" in <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>,
                            the Kohan are not always fighting. <br><br>

                            Whereas the gods may never tire, or at the very least, need rest, mere mortals do. The same applies to the Kohan's ability to wage war. The Kohan, like the <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a>, 
                            are made up of differing nations, government styles, and, to and extend, cultures. There is no single Kohan nation that has the capacity to wage war on the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            forever. They will run out of some resource - gold, food, people, armaments - at some point. As such, many Kohan groups band together, as part of coalitions, against the differing <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            factions, targeting just a handful (or even just one) of them. <br><br>

                            Due to this long enmity between the Kohan and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, all Kohan share an inherent distrust and hatred towards
                            the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>. There is no diplomatic relations between Kohan nations and <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            groups, not even minute trade between them. One may thing that this hatred and distrust would fall onto <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> as well. That is not the case.
                            The Kohan do not follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, nor do they worship him. However, they do not outright hate him - at least with their words - or insult him with
                            their speech. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> may be on the opposing side of the conflict, however, he is still a god. He still expects at least some respect from the Kohan. 
                            If they were to anger him, he would punish them; he has done it before. <br><br>

                            Similarly to the Kohan-<a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a> relations, the Kohan-<a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> relations
                            could be better. It varies depending on the <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> group and the Kohan nation involved. In the past, there have been attempts by some
                            Kohan to reintegrate the <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> into the Kohan. In some cases, they were successful. However, in the majority of attempts, they failed,
                            widening the gap between the <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> and the Kohan. However, in a general sense, there is some diplomatic relationships and trade agreements
                            between the two cultures. <br><br>

                            Unlike the <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a>, for the most part, the different Kohan nations do have some sort of religious intolerence. There is not a single Kohan who worships
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, and the vast majority worship <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> as their primary
                            god. As such, belief in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a> is enforced, and many Kohan groups do have an inquisition rooting out who they see as heretics.

                            <h3 class="text-center border-bottom border-top border-dark pt-3 pb-3">The Fallen</h3>
                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">The Cult of the Fallen, normally shortened to the Fallen, are those who follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, or those who agree that <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>
                            oversteps his bounds. Because of this, they are in complete opposition to the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>. Like the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>,
                            the Fallen are made up of several different nations, each with a varied culture, and similarly, each nation cannot truly maintain an "eternal" conflict. As such, the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a> changes between being a 
                            hot and cold war, as nations are able to fight. After the first coalition the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> created, the Fallen have adopted the same strategy.<br><br>

                            Ironically, even though there is great enmity between the Fallen and the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>, their cultures are very similar. Just as the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>
                            have a great hatred and distrust of the Fallen, the Fallen reciprocate those feelings towards the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>. Just as the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> disagree with 
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> but still respect him, the Fallen feel the same way towards <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html">Irollan</a>. They also believe that all within their society
                            should believe in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a>, and each state has an inquisition enforcing the pantheon. Finally, their relations with the <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> could be better.
                            Similarly to the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>, some Fallen nations have attempted to conquer some <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> groups, bringing them into the fold. As with the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>,
                            this has been conducted with a mixed success rate. <br><br>

                            Beyond the clear differences in the beliefs between the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> and the Fallen, the is one more stark difference. On the battlefield, the Fallen are not just humanoids. They are supplemented 
                            by the designs of Ahriman: Abberations, Fiends and Monstrosities. This helps make up for their lack of numerical superiority; the Fallen have never had the humanoid numbers when fighting the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>.
                            However, not all of these creatures want to keep fighting. Some of the ones with longer lifespans actually get sick of fighting and want to leave. For those that do leave, they are hunted wherever they go; the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a>
                            hate them, seeing them as abominations. The <a href="#ceyah" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ceyah')">Ceyah</a> do not want the <a href="#kohan" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#kohan')">Kohan</a> or the Fallen on their lands, hunting those creatures, so they hunt them as well.
                            The Fallen hunt them as well; if they allow any to truly escape, it would set a precedent unacceptable to both the Fallen and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>.

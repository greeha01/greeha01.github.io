            <br>

        <h4 id=beginning>The Beginning</h4>
        <p>It is not known how **Uesis, or many of the gods for that matter, came into being. They just were. It is known, however, the order in which
           they appeared; Uesis was first. He shaped the world in his image. He made the land, the seas, and everything in between. He even made both
           both of the moons of Khald&ucircn; Phobos and Deimos, carving them with the movement of his hand and the image in his mind.<br><br>

           **Fandir came next. He saw how bland the landscape was. The was nothing living - just plain old rock, dirt, and sand. With Uesis' permission,
           Fandir created the first life; grass across the land, trees in certain places, flowers elsewhere. He covered every inch of land, and parts of 
           the seabed, riverbed and lakebed on Khald&ucircn with plants, and it survived. Not only did it live, it thrived.<br><br>
           
           Uesis was astounded. Unwilling to have his creation outshone by Fandir, Uesis created life as well - but not just any life. He created the first 
           humanoids; humans, elves, dwarves and orcs. Fandir was inspired by these creations and created much of the woodland creatures known today. As such,
           he became more protective of the forest than the plains or hills, and took on the mantle of the **Forest Guardian, the protector of all who reside
           in the woods. Uesis kept creating as well, and didn't stop until he had created every sentient species still alive today.<br><br>

           Next came the **Twins: **Pyrus and **Tudalle. Both of them had an innate understanding of magic, and each put their knowledge to different purposes.
           Pyrus learned how to control magic through movement and words, and sometimes, with the help of some materials. Tudalle, on the other hand, figured
           out how to imbue mundane items with raw magic. As such, he quickly learned blacksmithing to test his designs. Both brothers used their knowledge
           and shared it with the peoples of Khald&ucircn; earning the trust of its inhabitants.<br><br>
           
           Soonafter, **Akrua appeared. She had designs unknown to even Tudalle. She showed them to Tudalle, and he made them for her; they were her armor, greatsword,
           longbow and arrows. She went to the peoples of Khald&ucircn and showed them her designs and Tudalle's works. Impressed, the people mimicked them,
           and created their own. At first, the weapons were only used by hunters to obtain a new delicacy: meat. Before this, it was unheard of. However, this peace
           did not last long. People's ambitions overtook them, and they gazed over at others' kingdoms, wanting. The first conflicts erupted; war was borne unto
           the peoples of Khald&ucircn.<br><br>

           The final three of the **Original Eight came: **Biara, **Ornella, and **Ahriman. Biara is a troublesome goddess. She clearly has power; she can easily
           distract others, while simultaneously stealing their belongings as if it was a game. Word of this trickled down to Khald&ucircn, and many found this inspiring.
           Robbery, of which was previously unheard, occurred. There was not a settlement on the plane that did not have a case. It was seen as a way to honor the new
           god. Eventually, Biara's hand strayed too far, stealing Uesis' crown. Outraged, he banished Biara from the **Divine Palace. It is unknown where she currently
           resides. Wherever she is, she still exerts her influence over the people of Khald&ucircn.<br><br>

           The number of souls roaming the world had been increasing since Uesis had created sentient beings. The rate had increased since war had been
           discovered. Ornella has an innate understanding of death and the dead. With the help of Uesis, she created **Celestials, the beings that lead the dead into the
           **Final Kingdom. Eventually, Celestials were brought into the service of every god, with some of them even being promoted to the status of Lesser Diety. She
           created the Final Kingdom, where the souls of the dead live, and since, has ruled over it.<br><br>

           Finally, there was Ahriman. The wars that had been occurring had been taking its toll on the land. Graves were everywhere. Abandoned equipment, ruins and 
           death covered the land. The land was scarred, and nothing was healing it. Only the woodlands were truly pristine, under the watchful eye of their Forest Guardian.
           Appointed as the **Caregiver of Khald&ucircn, Ahriman set out to heal the plane. He was successful, and started his role as caretaker, cleaning up after
           the inhabitants' messes. Inspired by the actions taken by Fandir, Ahriman created new creatures, approved by Uesis, to populate the savannas, the deserts, the plains
           and the mountains. He took revenge on those who damaged the land under his care, and war essentially stopped. An era of peace had been ushered in.
        </p>

        <h4 id="betrayal">The Betrayal</h4>
        <p>During this time of peace, the gods sometimes graced Khald&ucircn with their presence. Occasionally, they did more than visit the plane; they made friendships
           and had children with the peoples. These demigods were stronger than other humanoids; they had powers from their godly lineage with which normal people could
           not compare. They became great warriors, healers, mages, and politicians. In fact, this intermingling of mortal and divine was the era of peace's undoing.<br><br>
           
           One of these demigods went by the name Irollan. He was the son of Uesis, and upon reaching adulthood, quickly became known for his control over light from any source. 
           His fame of being the **Lightbender, son of the **Creator, spread across the land, even reaching the ears of Uesis himself. He went down to Khald&ucircn, to see this 
           for himself. He was not disappointed. Uesis approached his son, and made him the offer of a lifetime: a home at the Divine Palace and immortality. Needless to say,
           Irollan accepted, and took up the mantle of **Lightbringer, controller of the Sun.<br><br>

           Some children were inspired by this act, hoping to follow in Irollan's footsteps. Others, feeling shunned by their parents lack of involvement in their lives, acted out.
           They started to ignore the gods. They fought and desacrated the land. In response, Ahriman thought of the perfect punishment: creatures that hunted down humanoids. He 
           brought his designs ot Uesis, who rejected them - he could not see the pinnacle of his creations destroyed. Unabated, Ahriman kept working on his designs, showing them 
           to Uesis one by one. One by one, Uesis rejected them.<br><br>

           Fed up with Uesis' lack of a response, Ahriman took matters into his own hands. Those rebellious mortals were finally to get the punishment they deserved
           for their actions. He gave life to his creations, and unleashed them upon the world. He was immediately called to Uesis. Upon his arrival at the Divine Palace,
           Ahriman was stripped of his title as Caregiver of Khald&ucircn, and cast out from the his residence at the Divine Palace. Outraged, he stormed out of the palace,
           declaring that Uesis was blinded by his power and ego. The time of peace was over; the **Eternal War had come.
        </p>

        <h4 id="war">The Eternal War</h4>
        <p>With his exile, Ahriman retreated to his plane; the Abyss. It was on that plane where he had first created his nightmares. Here, he built his base of operations from which
           he would wage his war. When he finally returned to Khald&ucircn, he found that he was not alone. He had a made a statement, and that message had resonated with many people; 
           Uesis did not have full control of everything. In fact, there were many who would follow Ahriman to their deaths; they had even formed a group meant to fight Uesis
           and his followers: the **Cult of the Fallen. <br><br>

           In response to this, Uesis' followers formed their own group to fight the Fallen God and his followers: the Kohan**. The two sides brawled, and kept fighting, with neither
           side coming out on top. The only thing that piled up was bodies. The Kohan had the numbers, as well as a larger number of gods on their side. The Cult of the Fallen
           had Ahriman's gifts - abberations, fiends and monstronsities -  fighting alongside them. However, it soon became apparant that there were mortals on both sides that
           did not want to fight. <Br><br>

           These people, **the Ceyah, quickly grew sick of the war. They looked to the majority of the gods, and followed their example. In the Divine Palace, almost every 
           god was against the war. Only Irollan supported his father. Every other god, for their own reason, chose to stay neutral in the conflict. Their followers were the 
           majority of the Ceyah. Ironically enough, in order to stay neutral, the Ceyah needed to fight their own war, against both the Kohan and the Cult of the Fallen, to
           win their freedom. Quite quickly, Ahriman mandated that the Cult make peace with the Ceyah; they were not part of Uesis' hegemony and as such, were not his targets.
           Beyond this, if Uesis failed to make peace with the Ceyah, that would only uphold Ahriman's claim: Uesis was blinded by his power and ego. Soon after, the Kohan and
           the Ceyah made peace. <br><br>

           While it is difficulty to place an actual time to these events, it is known this is far in the past; Khald&ucircn, in a modern sense, has always known war, and
           it appears that it always will.

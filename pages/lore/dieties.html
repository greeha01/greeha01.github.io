                       orders, creating them anyway. As such, Ahriman was formally stripped of his title as Caregiver of Khald&ucircn, a grave 
                       insult. Ahriman declared Uesis to be a god blinded by his ego and status, unworthy to be followed or worshipped, and declared 
                       a war upon Uesis that will can only end in two ways: his death, or Uesis' death.</p>

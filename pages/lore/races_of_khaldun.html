                                    <h5 class="text-info text-center border-bottom border-danger">Godly Lineage</h5>
                                    <p>The Aasimar, in a basic sense, are children of gods, whether they be <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Greater_Dietiers">Greater Dieties</a> or one of the many
                                    <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties</a>. However, they are more than just members of the god's bloodline. They are given abilities by their
                                    godly parent, and the ability to have direct contact with said diety. <br><br>
                                    
                                    While in contact with their diety, an Aasimar's eyes turn glowing white, and their body hovers off the ground, as if someone is lifting them up. Their legs bend back,
                                    and their arms hover, wrists facing outwards. Some Aasimar consider their abilities a gift from the gods, something to be used to help others. Others believe
                                    it is a curse, something meant to torment them for their lineage.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class=col>
                                    <h5 class="text-info text-center border-bottom border-danger">Children of Two Worlds</h5>
                                    <p>The Aasimar in almost every sense are from two worlds: one parent from Khald&ucircn, and the other from the <a href="/pages/references.html#Divine_Palace">Divine Palace</a>.
                                    As such, every Aasimar has to try to balance their two halves. Their abilities are something that many attempt to keep secret; there are those in the world who would attempt
                                    to use said abilities to their own advantage. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Luckily for Aasimar, their appearance mimics that of the species of their non-godly parent. For instance, an Aasimar who's father is a human and mother is Akrua will look like a human,
                                    despite being fifty percent god. For those attempting to hide their true nature, their only real tell in when one attempts to initiate contact with their diety. </p>

                                    <p>Generally speaking, changelings, as described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War on page 17, are "pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair". For the most
                                    part, single-skins don't see a changeling's true form. Many will see a mask, and those who are closer may meet a persona. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Due to their ability to change their form, Changelings generally are not trusted by others. As such, in many communities, they are hunted, and if found, expelled, if not
                                    killed outright by their former community members. Due to this, changelings also tend to reciprocate that distrust to single-skins, for fear of their own lives.

                                    <p>Thought to be related to dragons, generally, Dragonborn are feared throughout Khald&ucircn. As such, many end up living their lives away from humanoids, at the very least,
                                    away from non-Dragonborn humanoids. Those that live on their own in the wild, live a nomadic lifestyle. They typically do not settle down, and bounce from place to place, picking
                                    up work as it appears. Others become mercenaries, working for the highest price. <br><br>

                                    Those who live in Dragonborn communities rarely leave it. They are safe spaces for Dragonborn, away from the persecution and discrimination they would experience in other place in the world.

                                    the dragons are seen as respected elders, senior members of their clan. Sometimes, for instance, when word reaches the community of a plot to target the dragons, a few of

                                    shape, they do not really seem to be all that similar to other humanoids. As such, many Lizardfolk live as outcasts in swamps, away from others, including other Lizardfolk. There is some interaction
                                    between these people, enough at least to call them a "people". However, there is no town or village. Each Lizardfolk lives on their own, and works to better their own life.

                                    life. Generally, Loxodons work as secretaries, inventory managers, or any job that requires a good memory.

                                    the other humanoids have. They need the extra space for hunting; more land means more animals.

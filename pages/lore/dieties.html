                                    <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Uesis is the original god, the true creator of Khald&ucircn. He shaped the world, welcomed the other gods,
                                    and made the <a href="/pages/references.html#First_Races">First Races</a>. His most common symbol reflects this combination of power and creation: the crown for his power
                                    as the God King, and the plus in a circle, for his never ending cycle of creation. He is fiercely protective, to some, overprotective, of the world he created.
                                    He is actively involved in the affairs of Khald&ucircn, specifically, the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a>. The <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a> 
                                    worship Uesis as their primary god, and shun the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fallen">Fallen</a>. Uesis, short
                                    of actually going to Khald&ucircn and fighting alongside his followers, does everything he can to help the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a>.
                                    He brokers deals between the different factions within the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a>, to ensure relative unity between his followers. If they
                                    are distracted by fractions in their alliances, they will have no hope of ever defeating the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fallen">Fallen</a>. <br><br>

                                    Prior to the start of the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>, Uesis was actively involved in the lives of everyone on Khald&ucircn. He had created every sentient race on the plane,
                                    and expected to be worshipped for it. The people would hold annual festivals for him, the largest being held on <a href="/pages/references.html#Life_Day">Life Day</a>, the day making the anniversary of the creation
                                    of the First Raes. Many people saw this ego as detrimental, however, for the most part, there was nothing they could do. That all changed when <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman" onclick="switchNav('#Ahriman', '#Greater_Dieties')">Ahriman</a>
                                    started his rebellion against Uesis. In contemporary terms, he no longer takes active part in most people's lives - only those of the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a>.

                                    <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Fandir was the second god, following in the footsteps of Uesis. In fact, Fandir created the first life, and shown in his symbol, mostly plant life, but also many of the animals that dwell
                                    in the forest. The life he created was not just reduced to live in the forest. He created many of the flowers, trees, grasses and other plants that are spread throughout
                                    the plane. It is just the animals that he created that were restricted to the forest. As such, he became very protective of the forests, actively punishing those who did
                                    harm to it. That being said, Fandir does make deals with mortals - allowing them to harvest trees in return for something, normally a commitment to plant a tree for every
                                    one cut down. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Fandir  guides the woodlands and the creatures that live within, including the humanoids created to live there. He may not have been their creator, but he is their
                                    protector; the god who cares about them the most. That being said, in the conflict between the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a> and the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fallen">Fallen</a>,
                                    Fandir generally does not take a side, allowing it to naturally end, if it ever does.

                                    of Khald&ucircn, she does not need to intervene personally in the world; she already made her impression on Khald&ucircn. <br><br>

                                    any light - a feat no one else could, or can, do. After one of his performances, Uesis approached Irollan, and offered him a godship. This offer was not merely to make

                                    Irollan was unable to refuse; he accepted, and ascended to the <a href="/pages/references.html#Divine_Palace">Divine Palace</a>, to spend his days with the other gods.
                                    Irollan put his powers to use, controlling the movement of not only the sun, but also the stars and moons. His symbol reflects that power over the light. He had his father to thank for his new position, and as such,
                                    supports him in everything. He is the only god beyond <a href="#Uesis" onclick="switchNav('#Uesis', null)">Uesis</a> and <a href="#Ahriman" onclick="switchNav('#Ahriman', null)">Ahriman</a>

                                    His followers, who have the same name as their organization, have broken away from the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fiden">Fiden</a>, and want nothing to do with <a href="#Uesis" onclick="switchNav('#Uesis', null)">Uesis</a> or <a href="#Irollan" onclick="switchNav('#Irollan', null)">Irollan</a>.
                                    Ahriman created life unlike anything produced by <a href="#Uesis" onclick="switchNav('#Uesis', null)">Uesis</a>; Abberations, Fiends and Monstrosities. After his designs were rejected by <a href="#Uesis" onclick="switchNav('#Uesis', null)">Uesis</a>, Ahriman defied his
                                    orders and created them anyway. As such, Ahriman was formally stripped of his title as Caregiver of Khald&ucircn, the worst insult <a href="#Uesis" onclick="switchNav('#Uesis', null)">Uesis</a> has been known to give. <br><br>

                                    Ahriman, fueled by his rage, declared <a href="#Uesis" onclick="switchNav('#Uesis', null)">Uesis</a> to be a god blinded by his ego and status, unworthy to be followed or worshipped, and began 
                                    a war upon Uesis that can only end in two ways: his death, or Uesis' death. His anger affects not just the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fallen">Fallen</a>, but all mortals of Khald&ucircn;
                                    They have to decide if they wish to participate in the war, and if so, on which side.

                                    it is no wonder that her symbol is a skull. Being one of the most recognizable symbols of death, its symbolism is obvious.
                                    All worship her; courting her ire may destroy one's chance at entrance to her kingdom. She is the original creator of the <a href="pages/references.html#Celestials">Celestials</a>,
                                    the entities that assist the gods in their multitude of tasks. A number of the more important ones have risen to the rank of <a href="#Lesser_Dieties" onclick="switchNav(null, '#Lesser_Dieties')">Lesser Diety</a><br><br>
                                    
                                    Since the dawn of the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>, Ornella has rarely interacted with other gods, and even less with living mortals.
                                    As such, those who do end up interacting with Ornella prior to their death are considered blessed by others. Ornella is completely pro-war, and does not want it to end.
                                    The war produces death, adding souls to her kingdom. As such, she also does not join a side. However, she does encourage her worshippers to participate as each death adds
                                    to her kingdom.

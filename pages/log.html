To balance any race which grants natural weapons such as Tabaxi claws, Lizardfolk bite, or Dragonborn claws, they instead deal one size larger dice. A Tabaxi's claws would deal d6 slashing damage, for example.</p></li>
                                                <li><p>When you score a critical hit, maximize your weapon's dice damage, then roll the bonus damage from a critical hit to prevent Critical Hits dealing less damage than normal. Do not maximize attachers such as Sneak Attack or Smite.</p></li>
                                                <li><p>During a grapple, Heavy or Two Handed weapons attack with disadvantage, while Light, Unarmed Strikes, and Bite attacks gain Advantage. This also has an added benefit of making weapons with Versatile more versatile!</p></li>

            <p>In general, the people of Khald&ucircn are split into three groups: **the Ceyah, **the Kohan, and the **Cult of the Fallen, sometimes called the Fallen.</p>

            <h3 id="ceyah">The Ceyah</h3>
            <p>The Ceyah are those who do not partake in the **Eternal Conflict. The initial Ceyah were those who didn not have Uesis, Irollan or Ahriman as their main god;
               those who followed Fandir, Akruam, Tudalle, Pyrus, Biara or Ornella refused to partake in the struggle. It became evident that there were some who followed the
               gods involved in the war that did not want to fight. They joined the Ceyah, and won their freedom. They retreated from the main two continents, Danmeny and Eaplas,
               settling on the 9 relatively uninhabited larger islands and island chains around the plane.
            </p>

            <h4 id="ceyah_warriors">Legendary Warriors of the Ceyah</h4>
            <p>By the time they had won their freedom, there were 12 members who had risen above the ranks, and were known on all three sides of the conflict. In fact,
               among Ceyah culture, they have been raised as heroes, almost revered as lesser **Lesser Dieties.

                       <b>Race</b>: Tabaxi<br>
                       Hasanko was a wizard known for his necromatic abilities. Devoted to Ornella, he served her every will. His powers were so strong that it is suspected
                       that he in fact was her son. He had no wish to partake in the war, and just wanted to be left in peace. Ironically enough, this meant he had to fight
                       to earn this peace. He quickly became known for his ability to continue a conflict until his opponents literally collapsed from exhaustion. After the
                       war, he retired to Kriti and its surrounding Islands, the entire archipelago thereby renamed Hasanko's Land.</p>

                       <b>Race</b>: It is unknown as all depictions of him display him in his mask. It is suspected from his height and skillset that he was a Wood Elf<br>
                       Prior to the war, Melchior was a renowned tracker and bounty hunter, adept at both archery and swords. As a follower of Akrua, he had no wish
                       to partake in the **Eternal Conflict. As such, he quickly joined the Ceyah when the war started. During the war, he his skill set was put to use
                       for scouting, where he became known for his brutal hit and runs. After the Ceyah made peace, he retired to the western islands, renamed in his honor:
                       Melchior's Archipelago.

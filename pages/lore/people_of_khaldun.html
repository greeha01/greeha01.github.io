            <p>In general, the people of Khald&ucircn are split into three groups: **the Ceyah, **the Kohan, and the **Cult of the Fallen, sometimes called the Fallen.</p>

            <h3 id="ceyah">The Ceyah</h3>
            <p>The Ceyah are those who do not partake in the **Eternal Conflict. The initial Ceyah were those who did not have Uesis, Irollan or Ahriman as their main god;
               those who followed Fandir, Akrua, Tudalle, Pyrus, Biara or Ornella refused to partake in the struggle. It became evident that there were some who followed the
               gods involved in the war that did not want to fight. They joined the Ceyah, and won their freedom. They retreated from the main three continents, Danmeny, Eaplas, and Istira,
               settling on the 8 relatively uninhabited larger islands and island chains around the plane.
            </p>

            <h4>Legendary Warriors of the Ceyah</h4>
            <p>By the time they had won their freedom, there were 12 members who had risen above the ranks, and were known on all three sides of the conflict. In fact,
               among Ceyah culture, they have been raised as heroes, almost revered as **Lesser Dieties.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Half-Elf<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Astarte was not well known prior to the war. She primary lived in the woods, honoring Fandir as much as she could. She was a hermit,
                       and only heard about the war from her communication with Fandir. He urged her to go, insisting that she would be needed for those who did not want to fight.
                       She herself was reluctant, but followed her orders. She joined the Ceyah, and was able to counter many of the beasts sent forth by the Fallen; Astarte called
                       and conjured many animals from the forest to help the Ceyah. Many times, these new allies turned the tide of the battle. After the war, she retired to the northeasternmost
                       islands in the plane, back into the forests from which she came. These forests, as the home of a legendary figure, became culturally religious to the Ceyah, and were
                       renamed Astarte's Lands, in honor of the hero.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Hobgoblin<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Belphegor was the shaman for his tribe. He would connect his people with their ancestors, and personally talk with the gods, or at the very least, their <a href="/../pages/references.html#Celestial">Celestials</a>>,
                          to improve the lifestyle of his tribe. One day, after the outbreak of the war, Belphegor was returning home after a meeting with the local goblinoid tribes - something
                          that had never happened before. He returned to see his tribe dead, with no clear sign as to the killers. After following the tracks, Belphegor discovered that one of the 
                          neighboring Orc tribes had murdered his family. He did some talking, and found out that the tribe had contract killers, who had worked for both the Kohan and the Fallen. 
                          Belphegor turned from both Ahriman and Uesis, and joined the Ceyah in their war. His charisma and direct line of communication to the gods won respect throughout the Ceyah,
                          earning him recognition unheard of for a hobgoblin. After the Ceyah won their freedom, Belphegor disappeared. It is suspected he continued fighting until his death, but no one knows for certain.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Halfling<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Divsha was an athlete. In fact, despite her small stature, was still one of the fastest humanoids during her time. She also had quick hands. During
                       athletic competitions, it is thought that she generally would steal from her hosts, unbeknowest to them at the time. That all changed when the war broke out. Using her fame,
                       Divsha recruited a number of well known thieves and bandits. Her Silent Stalkers, went ahead of Ceyah armies, and would strike in the middle of the night, destroying the
                       supplied needed by both the Kohan and Fallen armies. After the war, she retired to the bay region of the central island, as such being called Divsha's Bay in her honor.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Tabaxi<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Hasanko was a wizard known for his necromatic abilities. Devoted to Ornella, he served her every will. His powers were so strong that it is suspected
                       that he in fact was her son. He had no wish to partake in the war, and just wanted to be left in peace. Ironically enough, this meant he had to fight
                       to earn this peace. He quickly became known for his ability to continue a conflict until his opponents literally collapsed from exhaustion. After the
                       war, he retired to Kriti and its surrounding Islands, the entire archipelago thereby renamed Hasanko's Land.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Human<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Lazarus was a sorcerer of great power, known for his staff that earned him his strength and long life - he was the oldest of the 12
                       legendary Ceyah warriors, and he was the last one of them to die. In fact, he was known for his magic long before the war, especially for his cruel and odd
                       ways of helping local princes and other rulers. During the war, he continued to live up to his stories, draining the life out of his enemies, leaving behind
                       lifeless husks after finishing. Officially not truly dedicated to any one god, it is suspected that Lazarus received his staff and power from Tudalle, who
                       likely crafting his staff. It is not known where Lazarus retired after the war; he was a private man, and just disappeared from life.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: It is unknown as all depictions of him display him in his mask. It is suspected from his height and skillset that he was a Wood Elf<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Prior to the war, Melchior was a renowned tracker and bounty hunter, adept at both archery and swords. As a follower of Akrua, he had no wish
                       to partake in the **Eternal Conflict. As such, he quickly joined the Ceyah when the war started. During the war, he his skill set was put to use
                       for scouting, where he became known for his brutal hit and runs. After the Ceyah made peace, he retired to the western islands, renamed in his honor:
                       Melchior's Archipelago.

                       Prior to the war, Praxus was just like any other bandit: relatively unknown. He resided on the continent of Istira, moving from place to place. When the war broke out,
                       Praxus had no wish to partake. He left Istira, but the war followed anyway. Determined to live his life in peace, Praxus joined a fledgling movement opposing the war,
                       what would later be known as the Ceyah. Praxus used his background as one of the tacticians of the movement. He knew where the strike, when to strike and when to retreat.
                       Of his hundreds of operations, he only made one mistake: in the Battle of Northista (Kohan vs Ceyah), he over extended his battle lines, and the center broke. The Ceyah were
                       backed to the edge of a peninsula, there was nowhere to run - if the Ceyah lost this battle, they would have be wiped out. Instead, Praxus joined the battle, and using his lightning blade,
                       turned the tide. It cost him his life.

                       changed. Sahrbon began as just another wizard among the ranks of the Ceyah. However, she quickly rose high in the command due to her abilities. Somehow, she had learned
                       the secrets of draining one's life using just her staff. She was able to extract her enemies life, and used that energy to bestow strength upon the troops under her
                       command. This led her and her troops to become the shock troops of the Ceyah army, and led to her fame. After the war, she retired to the Small Infinite Isle

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Human<br>
                        Also known as the Mad Wizard, Sebak was an archmage from the capital of Fairfax Dynastry, Yuthua, on the continent of Istira. He specialized in creating poisons and acids
                        that would be spread in a magical manner. After the Ceyah became a well known resistance, Sebak joined upon the premise that he could test his concoctions. They did not
                        disappoint. They may have single handedly won the war. Very few could survive them, and none survived the Ceyah assault afterwards. As quickly as Sebak joined the Ceyah,
                        he disappeared just as quickly afterwards.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Lizardfolk<br>
                       Sijansur was a devout monk of Akrua. It is said that his relationship with his patron god was like no other for godly nonfamilial relationships. He followed her
                       every word, and had her respect. He was one of the few mortals who had been able to reason with her. His monastary has long been lost to war and time, but his memory
                       still stands. Armed with only a poleaxe, Sijansur would charge ahead into battle ahead of every other Ceyah, armorless. It was as if he could embrace the emotions pf his goddess,
                       and use it to his supplement his combat ability. After the war, Sijansur retired to the island of Haven, and founded a new monastary devoted to Akrua.

                       Ironically enough, Vandal never was a Ceyah. He just happened to align with the Ceyah during their war with the Kohan and the Fallen. Vandal was the leader of the
                       largest orc tribe Khald&ucircn has ever known. As a young orc, Vandal saw the war break out across the continent of Istira, as well as the political instability it
                       brought. He quickly rose to lead his tribe, and did something no other orc has been able to do since. He united the orcs tribes across the continent against the Kohan
                       and Fallen, providing a well needed ally to the Ceyah.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Human<br>
                       Vulgari was the leader of the Pyrus Sect, the organization dedicated to the worship of Pyrus. It is said that in a trance, Pyrus came to Vulgari, and urged him
                       to forsake both the Kohan and Fallen, and go his own way, distinct from the followers of Uesis, Irollan and Ahriman. Vulgari interpreted this as to joining the Ceyah.
                       Despite not being renowned on the battlefield, Vulgari brought the political and support power of the Pyrus Sect to the Ceyah, the backing that the group needed to survive.
                       After the war, Vulgari oversaw the move of the Pyrus Sect from Istira to Widestable Island.

            <h3 id="kohan">The Kohan</h3>
            <p>Generally speaking, the Kohan are the people who primarily worship Uesis or Irollan. However, those who have been wronged by the Fallen in some way also may be part of the Kohan.
               In a broad sense, the Kohan are those who oppose Ahriman and his followers; those who reject the idea that Uesis is a god blinded by his ego and status. Despite the usage of "the Kohan"
               as a single broad entity, sprawling across Khald&ucircn, that is not the case. There are three subcategories of the Kohan: the Royalists, the Nationalists, and the Council, each of which
               having their own heroes and idols.
            </p>

            <h4>The Royalists</h4>
            <p>The Royalists are the subcategory of the Kohan that fight because their ruler ordered them to do so. The heroes of these people are all great political or religious leaders,
               renowned for their battlefield valor or their political and religious actions. 
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-light">The heroes of the Royalists will come as players learn about them</p>

            <h4>The Nationalists</h4>
            <p>The Nationalists are the Kohan who fight to bring about a united people, one people under Uesis. In their image, there would be no need for kingdoms or democracies, with the exception
               of the single united people of Khald&ucircn, with Uesis as their main group. Generally speaking, many Uesis' zealots form the ranks of the Nationalists. 
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-light">The heroes of the Nationalists will come as players learn about them</p>

            <h4>The Council</h4>
            <p>The Council are the Kohan who fight against the Fallen because they believe that it is the right thing to do. In their eyes, the creations of Ahriman are disgusting, unearthly creatures
               that never should have been made. Their creation, meant to murder humanoids who disrespect the land, was an injustice, and as such, the Council have set out to right said injustice. 
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-light">The heroes of the Council will come as players learn about them</p>

            <h3 id="fallen">The Fallen</h3>
            <p>The Cult of the Fallen, normally shortened to the Fallen, are those who follow Ahriman, or those who agree that Uesis oversteps his bounds. Beyond this, the Fallen are 
               supplemented by the designs of Ahriman: Abberations, Fiends and Monstrosities.

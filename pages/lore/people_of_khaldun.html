                            <h3 class="text-center border-bottom border-top border-dark pb-3 pt-3">The Ventusi</h3>
                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Of the three general groups the people of Khald&ucircn can be divided into, 
                            the Ventusi are those who are neutral in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>. The initial Ventusi were those who did not follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>;
                            generally, those who followed <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Akrua">Akrua</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Pyrus">Pyrus</a>,
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ornella">Ornella</a> refused to partake in the struggle. It became evident that there were some who followed the
                            gods involved in the war that also did not want to fight. They joined the Ventusi, and after a hard-fought war, won their freedom. They retreated from the main three continents, 
                            <a href="/pages/landmasses/danmeny.html">Danmeny</a>, <a href="/pages/landmasses/eaplas.html">Eaplas</a>, and <a href="/pages/landmasses/istira.html">Istira</a>,
                            settling on the relatively uninhabited larger islands and island chains around the plane.<br><br>

                            Once, during the <a href="/pages/references.html#Ventusi_Rebellion">Ventusi Rebellion</a>, the Ventusi were a united people. Their attempt to escape the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>
                            united them. After they won, there was not a common thread throughout every Ventusi individual. Among them, there were worshippers to every <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Greater_Dieties">Greater Deity</a>, as well as
                            worshippers for many of the <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties</a>. Since then, they have fractured, broken apart into many different groups and nations across their lands. Some sects 
                            of the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a> have attempted to use this disunity to conquer some Ventusi groups, to a varying degree
                            of success. More generally, the Ventusi end up living away from the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, with their only interaction
                            being between diplomatic dignitaries and traders. <br><br>

                            Even though the idea of a united Ventusi no longer exists, there still are a number cultural similarities between many, if not all, of the Ventusi. Many believe in some sort
                            of religious freedom. As such, there is no one enforced diety, or even pantheon of dieties, that is enforced across the Ventusi. Despite the vast majority of the Ventusi believing
                            in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a>, there are some agnostic and atheistic Ventusi. Because of their cultural similarities,
                            many Ventusi innately trust other Ventusi much more than they would a <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> individual or a <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            person. Because of this, both business and personal relationships between Ventusi and the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            are fragile, and break easily.

                            <p>By the time they had won their freedom, there were 12 members who had risen above the ranks, and were known on all three sides of the conflict. In fact,
                            among Ventusi culture, they have been raised as heroes, almost revered as <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Lesser_Dieties">Lesser Dieties.

                                    <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Ermitana was not well known prior to the war. She primary lived in the woods, honoring <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a> as much as she could. She was a hermit,
                                    and only heard about the war from her communication with <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a>. He urged her to go, insisting that she would be needed for those who did not want to fight.
                                    She herself was reluctant, but followed her orders. She joined the Ventusi, and was able to counter many of the beasts sent forth by the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>; Ermitana called
                                    and conjured many animals from the forest to help the Ventusi. Many times, these new allies turned the tide of the battle. After the war, she retired to the northeasternmost
                                    islands in the plane, back into the forests from which she came. These forest islands, as the home of a legendary figure, became culturally significant to the Ventusi, and were
                                    renamed <a href="/pages/landmasses/Ermitanas_land.html">Ermitana's Lands</a>, in honor of the hero.

                                    <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Flaminus was the shaman for his tribe. He would connect his people with their ancestors, and personally talk with the gods, or at the very least, their <a href="/pages/references.html#Celestial">Celestials</a>,
                                        to improve the lifestyle of his tribe. One day, after the outbreak of the war, Flaminus was returning home after a meeting with the local goblinoid tribes - something
                                        that had never happened before. He returned to see his tribe dead, with no clear sign as to the killers. After following the tracks, Flaminus discovered that one of the 
                                        neighboring Orc tribes had murdered his family. He did some talking, and found out that the tribe were contract killers, who had worked for both the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>. 
                                        Flaminus turned from both <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, and joined the Ventusi in their war. His charisma and direct line of communication to the gods won respect throughout the Ventusi,
                                        earning him recognition unheard of for a hobgoblin. After the Ventusi won their freedom, Flaminus disappeared. It is suspected he continued fighting until his death, but no one knows for certain.

                                    Of his hundreds of operations, he only made one mistake: in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Battle_of_Northista">Battle of Northista</a> (<a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> vs Ventusi), he over extended his battle lines, and the center broke.

                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Of the three general cultures of the peoples of Khald&ucircn, the Fiden are those who primarily worship <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a>. 
                            However, those who have been wronged by the Fallen in some way, or hate <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>'s creations also may be part of the Fiden.
                            In a broad sense, the Fiden are those who oppose <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> and his followers; those who reject the idea that Uesis is a god blinded by his ego and status. This
                            puts them at odds with the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, and makes them belligerents in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>, the struggle
                            between <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> that has plagued Khald&ucircn for millenia. However, despite the "Eternal" in <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>,
                            the Fiden are not always fighting. <br><br>

                            Whereas the gods may never tire, or at the very least, need rest, mere mortals do. The same applies to the Fiden's ability to wage war. The Fiden, like the <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a>, 
                            are made up of differing nations, government styles, and, to and extend, cultures. There is no single Fiden nation that has the capacity to wage war on the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            forever. They will run out of some resource - gold, food, people, armaments - at some point. As such, many Fiden groups band together, as part of coalitions, against the differing <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            factions, targeting just a handful (or even just one) of them. <br><br>

                            Due to this long enmity between the Fiden and the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>, all Fiden share an inherent distrust and hatred towards
                            the <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>. There is no diplomatic relations between Fiden nations and <a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a>
                            groups, not even minute trade between them. One may thing that this hatred and distrust would fall onto <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> as well. That is not the case.
                            The Fiden do not follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, nor do they worship him. However, they do not outright hate him - at least with their words - or insult him with
                            their speech. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> may be on the opposing side of the conflict, however, he is still a god. He still expects at least some respect from the Fiden. 
                            If they were to anger him, he would punish them; he has done it before. <br><br>

                            Similarly to the Fiden-<a href="#fallen" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fallen')">Fallen</a> relations, the Fiden-<a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> relations
                            could be better. It varies depending on the <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> group and the Fiden nation involved. In the past, there have been attempts by some
                            Fiden to reintegrate the <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> into the Fiden. In some cases, they were successful. However, in the majority of attempts, they failed,
                            widening the gap between the <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> and the Fiden. However, in a general sense, there is some diplomatic relationships and trade agreements
                            between the two cultures. <br><br>

                            Unlike the <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a>, for the most part, the different Fiden nations do have some sort of religious intolerence. There is not a single Fiden who worships
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, and the vast majority worship <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> or <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> as their primary
                            god. As such, belief in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a> is enforced, and many Fiden groups do have an inquisition rooting out who they see as heretics.

                            <h3 class="text-center border-bottom border-top border-dark pt-3 pb-3">The Fallen</h3>
                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">The Cult of the Fallen, normally shortened to the Fallen, are those who follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>, or those who agree that <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>
                            oversteps his bounds. Because of this, they are in complete opposition to the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> in the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a>. Like the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>,
                            the Fallen are made up of several different nations, each with a varied culture, and similarly, each nation cannot truly maintain an "eternal" conflict. As such, the <a href="/pages/lore/divine_history.html#war">Eternal War</a> changes between being a 
                            hot and cold war, as nations are able to fight. After the first coalition the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> created, the Fallen have adopted the same strategy.<br><br>

                            Ironically, even though there is great enmity between the Fallen and the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>, their cultures are very similar. Just as the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>
                            have a great hatred and distrust of the Fallen, the Fallen reciprocate those feelings towards the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>. Just as the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> disagree with 
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> but still respect him, the Fallen feel the same way towards <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html">Irollan</a>. They also believe that all within their society
                            should believe in the <a href="/pages/references.html#Khaldun_Pantheon">Khald&ucircn Pantheon</a>, and each state has an inquisition enforcing the pantheon. Finally, their relations with the <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> could be better.
                            Similarly to the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>, some Fallen nations have attempted to conquer some <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> groups, bringing them into the fold. As with the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>,
                            this has been conducted with a mixed success rate. <br><br>

                            Beyond the clear differences in the beliefs between the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> and the Fallen, the is one more stark difference. On the battlefield, the Fallen are not just humanoids. They are supplemented 
                            by the designs of Ahriman: Abberations, Fiends and Monstrosities. This helps make up for their lack of numerical superiority; the Fallen have never had the humanoid numbers when fighting the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>.
                            However, not all of these creatures want to keep fighting. Some of the ones with longer lifespans actually get sick of fighting and want to leave. For those that do leave, they are hunted wherever they go; the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a>
                            hate them, seeing them as abominations. The <a href="#ventusi" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#ventusi')">Ventusi</a> do not want the <a href="#fiden" onclick="switchNav2(null, '#fiden')">Fiden</a> or the Fallen on their lands, hunting those creatures, so they hunt them as well.
                            The Fallen hunt them as well; if they allow any to truly escape, it would set a precedent unacceptable to both the Fallen and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>.

            <p>In general, the people of Khald&ucircn are split into three groups: **the Ceyah, **the Kohan, and the **Cult of the Fallen, sometimes called the Fallen.</p>

            <h3 id="ceyah">The Ceyah</h3>
            <p>The Ceyah are those who do not partake in the **Eternal Conflict. The initial Ceyah were those who didn not have Uesis, Irollan or Ahriman as their main god;
               those who followed Fandir, Akruam, Tudalle, Pyrus, Biara or Ornella refused to partake in the struggle. It became evident that there were some who followed the
               gods involved in the war that did not want to fight. They joined the Ceyah, and won their freedom. They retreated from the main two continents, Danmeny and Eaplas,
               settling on the 9 relatively uninhabited larger islands and island chains around the plane.
            </p>

            <h4 id="ceyah_warriors">Legendary Warriors of the Ceyah</h4>
            <p>By the time they had won their freedom, there were 12 members who had risen above the ranks, and were known on all three sides of the conflict. In fact,
               among Ceyah culture, they have been raised as heroes, almost revered as lesser **Lesser Dieties.

                    <h5 class="text-center">Astarte</h5>
                    <p><b>Race</b>: Half-Elf<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Astarte was not well known prior to the war. She primary lived in the woods, honoring Fandir as much as she could. She was a hermit,
                       and only heard about the war from her communication with Fandir. He urged her to go, insisting that she would be needed for those who did not want to fight.
                       She herself was reluctant, but followed her orders. She joined the Ceyah, and was able to counter many of the beasts sent forth by the Fallen; Astarte called
                       and conjured many animals from the forest to help the Ceyah. Many times, these new allies turned the tide of the battle. After the war, she retired to the northeasternmost
                       islands in the plane, back into the forests from which she came. These forests, as the home of a legendary figure, became culturally religious to the Ceyah, and were
                       renamed Astarte's Lands, in honor of the hero.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-center">Belphegor</h5>
                    <p><b>Race</b>: Hobgoblin<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Belphegor was the shaman for his tribe. He would connect his people with their ancestors, and personally talk with the gods, or at the very least, their Celestials,
                          to improve the lifestyle of his tribe. One day, after the outbreak of the war, Belphegor was returning home after a meeting with the local goblinoid tribes - something
                          that had never happened before. He returned to see his tribe dead, with no clear sign as to the killers. After following the tracks, Belphegor discovered that one of the 
                          neighboring Orc tribes had murdered his family. He did some talking, and found out that the tribe had contract killers, who had worked for both the Kohan and the Fallen. 
                          Belphegor turned from both Ahriman and Uesis, and joined the Ceyah in their war. His charisma and direct line of communication to the gods won respect throughout the Ceyah,
                          earning him recognition unheard of for a hobgoblin. After the Ceyah won their freedom, Belphegor disappeared. It is suspected he continued fighting until his death, but no one knows for certain.

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Halfling<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Divsha was an athlete. In fact, despite her small stature, was still one of the fastest humanoids during her time. She also had quick hands. During
                       athletic competitions, she generally would steal from her hosts, unbeknowest to them at the time. FINISH</p>

                    <h5 class="text-center">Hasanko Bloodline</h5>
                    <p><b>Race</b>: Tabaxi<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Hasanko was a wizard known for his necromatic abilities. Devoted to Ornella, he served her every will. His powers were so strong that it is suspected
                       that he in fact was her son. He had no wish to partake in the war, and just wanted to be left in peace. Ironically enough, this meant he had to fight
                       to earn this peace. He quickly became known for his ability to continue a conflict until his opponents literally collapsed from exhaustion. After the
                       war, he retired to Kriti and its surrounding Islands, the entire archipelago thereby renamed Hasanko's Land.</p>

                    <p><b>Race</b>: Human<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Lazarus was a sorcerer of great power, known for his staff that earned him his strength and long life - he was the oldest of the 12
                       legendary Ceyah warriors, and he was the last one of them to die. In fact, he was known for his magic long before the war, especially for his cruel and odd
                       ways of helping local princes and other rulers. During the war, he continued to live up to his stories, draining the life out of his enemies, leaving behind
                       lifeless husks after finishing. Officially not truly dedicated to any one god, it is suspected that Lazarus received his staff and power from Tudalle, who
                       likely crafting his staff. It is not known where Lazarus retired after the war; he was a private man, and just disappeared from life.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-center">Melchior</h5>
                    <p><b>Race</b>: It is unknown as all depictions of him display him in his mask. It is suspected from his height and skillset that he was a Wood Elf<br>
                       <b>Description</b>: Prior to the war, Melchior was a renowned tracker and bounty hunter, adept at both archery and swords. As a follower of Akrua, he had no wish
                       to partake in the **Eternal Conflict. As such, he quickly joined the Ceyah when the war started. During the war, he his skill set was put to use
                       for scouting, where he became known for his brutal hit and runs. After the Ceyah made peace, he retired to the western islands, renamed in his honor:
                       Melchior's Archipelago.

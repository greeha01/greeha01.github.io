                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">It is not known how <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, or many of the gods for that matter, came into being. They just were. It is known, however, the order in which
                            they appeared; <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> was first. He shaped the world in his image. He made the land, the seas, and everything in between. He even made both
                            both of the moons of Khald&ucircn; Phobos and Deimos, carving them with the movement of his hand and the image in his mind.<br><br>

                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a> came next. He saw how bland the landscape was. The was nothing living - just plain old rock, dirt, and sand. With <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>' permission,
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a> created the first life; grass across the land, trees in certain places, flowers elsewhere. He covered every inch of land, and parts of 
                            the seabed, riverbed and lakebed on Khald&ucircn with plants, and it survived. Not only did it live, it thrived.<br><br>
                            
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> was astounded. Unwilling to have his creation be outshone by <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> created life as well - but not just any life. He created the first 
                            humanoids; humans, elves, dwarves and orcs. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a> was inspired by these creations and created much of the woodland creatures known today. As such,
                            he became more protective of the forest than the plains or hills, and took on the mantle of the Forest Guardian, the protector of all who reside
                            in the woods. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> kept creating as well, and didn't stop until he had created every sentient species still alive today.<br><br>

                            Next came the twins: <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Pyrus">Pyrus</a> and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>. Both of them had an innate understanding of magic, and each put their knowledge to different purposes.
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Pyrus">Pyrus</a> learned how to control magic through movement and words, and sometimes, with the help of some materials. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>, on the other hand, figured
                            out how to imbue mundane items with raw magic. As such, he quickly learned blacksmithing to test his designs. Both brothers used their knowledge
                            and shared it with the peoples of Khald&ucircn; earning the trust of its inhabitants.<br><br>
                            
                            Soonafter, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Akrua">Akrua</a> appeared. She had designs unknown to even <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>. She showed them to <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>, and he made them for her; they were her armor, greatsword,
                            longbow and arrows. She went to the peoples of Khald&ucircn and showed them her designs and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Tudalle">Tudalle</a>'s works. Impressed, the people mimicked them,
                            and created their own. At first, the weapons were only used by hunters to obtain a new delicacy: meat. Before this, it was unheard of. However, this peace
                            did not last long. People's ambitions overtook them, and they gazed over at others' kingdoms, wanting. The first conflicts erupted; war was borne unto
                            the peoples of Khald&ucircn.<br><br>

                            The final three of the Original Eight came: <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ornella">Ornella</a>, and <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a> is a troublesome goddess. She clearly has power; she can easily
                            distract others, while simultaneously stealing their belongings as if it was a game. Word of this trickled down to Khald&ucircn, and many found this inspiring.
                            Robbery, of which was previously unheard, occurred. There was not a settlement on the plane that did not have a case. It was seen as a way to honor the new
                            god. Eventually, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a>'s hand strayed too far, stealing <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>' crown. Outraged, he banished <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Biara">Biara</a> from the <a href="/pages/references.html#Divine_Palace">Divine Palace</a>. It is unknown where she currently
                            resides. Wherever she is, she still exerts her influence over the people of Khald&ucircn.<br><br>

                            The number of souls roaming the world had been increasing since <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> had created sentient beings. The rate had increased since war had been
                            invented. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ornella">Ornella</a> has an innate understanding of death and the dead. With the help of <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, she created <a href="/pages/references.html#Celestial">Celestials</a>, the beings that lead the dead into the
                            <a href="/pages/references.html#Final_Kingdom">Final Kingdom</a>. Eventually, <a href="/pages/references.html#Celestial">Celestials</a> were brought into the service of every god, with some of them even being promoted to the status of Lesser Diety. She
                            created the <a href="/pages/references.html#Final_Kingdom">Final Kingdom</a>, where the souls of the dead live, and since, has ruled over it.<br><br>

                            Finally, there was <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>. The wars that had been occurring had been taking its toll on the land. Graves were everywhere. Abandoned equipment, ruins and 
                            death covered the land. The land was scarred, and nothing was healing it. Only the woodlands were truly pristine, under the watchful eye of their Forest Guardian.
                            Appointed as the Caregiver of Khald&ucircn, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> set out to heal the plane. He was successful, and started his role as caretaker, cleaning up after
                            the inhabitants' messes. Inspired by the actions taken by <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Fandir">Fandir</a>, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> created new creatures, approved by <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, to populate the savannas, the deserts, the plains
                            and the mountains. He took revenge on those who damaged the land under his care, and war essentially stopped. An era of peace had been ushered in.

                            <h3 class="text-center border-top border-bottom border-dark pt-3 pb-3">The Betrayal</h3>

                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">During this time of peace, the gods sometimes graced Khald&ucircn with their presence. Occasionally, they did more than visit the plane; they forged relationships
                            and had children with the peoples. These demigods were stronger than other humanoids; they had powers from their godly lineage with which normal people could
                            not compare. They became great warriors, healers, mages, and politicians. In fact, this intermingling of mortal and divine was the era of peace's undoing.<br><br>
                            
                            One of these demigods went by the name <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a>. He was the son of <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, and upon reaching adulthood, quickly became known for his control over light from any source. 
                            His fame of being the Lightbender, son of the Creator, spread across the land, even reaching the ears of <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> himself. He went down to Khald&ucircn, to see this 
                            for himself. He was not disappointed. <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> approached his son, and made him the offer of a lifetime: a home at the <a href="/pages/references.html#Divine_Palace">Divine Palace</a> and immortality. Needless to say,
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> accepted, and took up the mantle of Lightbringer, controller of the Sun.<br><br>

                            Some children were inspired by this act, hoping to follow in <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a>'s footsteps. Others, feeling shunned by their parents lack of involvement in their lives, acted out.
                            They started to ignore the gods. They fought and desacrated the land. In response, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> thought of the perfect punishment: creatures that hunted down humanoids. He 
                            brought his designs ot <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>, who rejected them - he could not see the pinnacle of his creations destroyed. Unabated, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> kept working on his designs, showing them 
                            to <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> as he finished them. One by one, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> rejected them.<br><br>

                            Fed up with <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>' lack of a response, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> took matters into his own hands. In his eyes, the rebellious mortals were finally to get the punishment they deserved. 
                            He gave life to his creations, and unleashed them upon the world. He was immediately called to <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>. Upon his arrival at the <a href="/pages/references.html#Divine_Palace">Divine Palace</a>,
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> was stripped of his title as Caregiver of Khald&ucircn, and cast out. Outraged, he stormed out of the palace,
                            declaring that <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> was blinded by his power and ego. The time of peace was over; the <a href=#war onclick="switchNav(null, '#war')">Eternal War</a> had come.

                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">With his exile, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> retreated to his plane; the Abyss. It was on that plane where he had first created his nightmares. Here, he built his base of operations from which
                            he would wage his war. When he finally returned to Khald&ucircn, he found that he was not alone. He had a made a statement, and that message had resonated with many people; 
                            <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> did not have full control of everything. In fact, there were many who would follow <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> to their deaths; they had even gone so far as to form a group meant to fight <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>
                            and his followers: the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fallen">Cult of the Fallen.</a> <br><br>

                            In response to this, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>' followers formed their own group to fight the <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Fallen God</a> and his followers: the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#kohan">Kohan</a>. The two sides brawled, and kept fighting, with neither
                            side coming out on top. The only thing that piled up was bodies. <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#kohan">The Kohan</a> had the numbers whereas the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#fallen">Fallen</a>
                            had <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a>'s gifts - abberations, fiends and monstronsities. However, it soon became apparant that there were mortals on both sides that
                            did not want to fight. <br><br>

                            These people, the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#ventusi">Ventusi</a>, quickly grew sick of the war. They looked to the majority of the gods, and followed their example. In the <a href="/pages/references.html#Divine_Palace">Divine Palace</a>, almost every 
                            god was against the war. Only <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Irollan">Irollan</a> supported his father. Every other god, for their own reason, chose to stay neutral in the conflict. Their followers were the 
                            majority of the Ventusi. Ironically enough, in order to stay neutral, the Ventusi needed to fight their own war, against both the Kohan and the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun#fallen">the Fallen</a>, to
                            win their freedom. Quite quickly, <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman">Ahriman</a> mandated that the Cult make peace with the Ventusi; they were not part of <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a>' hegemony and as such, were not his targets.
                            Beyond this, if <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> failed to make peace with the Ventusi, that would only uphold <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Ahriman"></a>Ahriman</a>'s claim: <a href="/pages/lore/dieties.html#Uesis">Uesis</a> was blinded by his power and ego. Soon after, the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun">Kohan</a> and
                            the <a href="/pages/lore/people_of_khaldun.html#ventusi">Ventusi</a> made peace.

                                    <h4 class="border-top border-bottom border-dark text-center pb-3 pt-3">Kriti</h4>
                                    <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">Kriti is the main island in Divinus' Archipelago. To the north lies Thanisi, the west, Kyklisi, and the south, Roovnisi. Every nation on Kriti is part of the
                                    <a href="/pages/references.html#Divinus_Confederation">Divinus Confederation</a>, the political body ruling the archipelago. Within the confederation there are eleven states: nine on Kriti itself, and two on
                                    the other islands, namely Kyklisi and Roovnisi. The map below shows the capitals of the nine Kritian states, all of which share their names with their state.
                                    Originally, there were thirteen states on the islands. However, the southern desert kingdom on Kriti, and the peoples of Thanisi withered with their land.<br><br>

                                    Being part of a larger political union, every state uses the same money, and has a number of laws that are consistent throughout the confederation. Each states contributes a certain percentage of their tax as well as produced material
                                    goods to a central stockpile, which is used to ensure that every state has adequate access to commercial goods. Other nations can trade with any state within the confederation, or with the Divinus Confederation as a whole.
                                    There is also a national army, comprised of recruits from every state, in addition to the small militias employed by each region. However, this army is used much more as a national guard;
                                    its purpose is to defend the archipelago from invasion, as well as to restore order in rebellious provinces.<br><br>

                                    Beyond this, the government provides a number of guilds, meant to improve the welfare of its citizens. Among these, the most important are the Healer's Guild, which is a rudimentary hospital system used throughout the archipelago, and the Adventurer's
                                    Guild, used to protect people from threats too unusual or small for the national guard. In fact, it is rare to find a healer or adventurer who is not or was not at some point part of these guilds. <br><br>

                                    The people of Kriti and the Divinus Confederation are almost as diverse as one can find on Khald&ucircn. One can find every <a href="/pages/lore/races_of_khaldun.html">species</a> one would normally expect to find, as well as a number of less
                                    common humanoid species.<br><br>

                                    <h4 class="border-top border-bottom border-dark text-center pb-3 pt-3">The Duchy of Kissamo</h4>
                                    <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3">The Duchy of Kissamo extends across the Kissaman peninsula, ending roughly halfway through the Northern Mountains. The terrain is predominately rolling 
                                    hills, just steep enough to make farming difficult. As such, much of the time, the duchy ends up importing the majority of its food from the confederation stockpile.<br><br>
                                    
                                    What the duchy lacks in arable land, it makes up in its mining capacity. A number of gemstones, as well as sizable iron, gold, silver and copper deposits have been discovered over the 
                                    years, leading to the duchy's vast wealth for such a small region. In contemporary terms, there three major mines still open in the mountains, as well as a large number of abandoned
                                    ones as their veins dried up. <br><br>

                                    In the region, there are two main settlements, the capital of the duchy, Kissamo, and the main mining center, Noltodir. Kissamo is a coastal city, with a bustling port; it is the main 
                                    city where people enter and exit the duchy and also the only true trade node in the region. Almost every marketable resource and good produced in the duchy is funneled through the capital,
                                    and almost all imported resources and goods enter through Kissamo. As such, the city hosts almost every Guild Headquarter for the region, with the notable exception of the Miner's Guild Headquarters. <br><br>

                                    That is located in Noltodir. Being the main mining center, situated in the middle of the Northern Mountains, it makes perfect sense. The town was founded by a group of Dwarves who became rich from the rich veins in the mountains.
                                    Hearing of their success, others started moving to the town, exponentially increasing the town's population. Once almost as large as Kissamo, Noltodir has slowly begun to wane; as more
                                    ore veins dry up, the more the city shrinks. Now, the city would be lucky to be called a small town. Despite this turn in its fortune, the Miner's Guild still is headquartered in the town, and has no plans on moving
                                    unless another settlement becomes the center of mining in the region. <br><br>

                                    Throughout the hills of the duchy, there are a number of unmapped villages and hamlets, eking out an existance in the relatively inhospitable land. In comparison to the capital and the mining towns, they have little population,
                                    and as such, are afterthoughts in the minds of the politicians, the bureaucrats and the Duke of Kissamo. Whereas many of those living in Kissamo or Noltodir are ambivalent, if not accepting of the Duke and those running the duchy,
                                    the people living in the rural villages dislike them.

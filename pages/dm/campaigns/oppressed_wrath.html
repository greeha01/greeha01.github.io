                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3"><b class="text-danger">The Basic Plot:</b> The party is a group of new adventurers on their first mission together. They have been dispatched to investigate the calls for help from a village on the edge of Lakeside Forest, Astrakane.
                            Their investigation will lead them into the forest upon which they will find the cause of these disappearances: an Alpha Wolf.

                            <p class="border-bottom border-dark pb-3"><b class="text-danger">Extended Plot:</b> At first, the party will be on the road, heading to Astrakane. Any player that has a passive perception higher than 15, or the player(s)
                            with the highest passive perception should every PC have a passive perception lower than 15 will have an innate sensation that they are being watched. In fact, they are being observed. Lilith, in assassin form, is watching them, as well
                            as some of the wolves under the influence of the alpha wolf.<br><br>
                        
                            Upon entering the village (or the area around the village), the party should notice that things are not as they should. The people are scared - holed up in their homes and such. When they meet with the mayor and sheriff, both will be very conducive to helping the party in any way they can (as described in their
                            parts of the NPCs homebrewery link). The party should have several options open to them after this.<br><br>

                            Should they decide to talk to the townsfolk, they really won't get anywhere; they are scared and will believe that the party suspects them of murder, or at least aiding and abetting a murderer. If they talk to the priest, it will be the same story, but just because the priest does not have faith in the villagers.<br><br>

                            Should they go into the forest to look for clues, the feeling of being watched will intensify immensely. Any character with at least a 10 passive perception will be able to feel it now. Should they be in the forest come night, they will most likely be attacked by the wolves.
                            Likewise, should they come across the wolves' den they will be attacked (both by the alpha wolf as well as 2 * (PC amount - 1) wolves if Sheriff Atresk is with them. Otherwise, it is the alpha wolf and 2 * (PC amount - 2) wolves). <br><br>

                            Upon returning triumphantly, if it is close to the evening/still night, the mayor will offer lodging in the village hall. Similarly, he will insist that they stay until Fashum and Jodove Dohke return as he has made a promise that he would attempt to introduce 
                            Adventurer's Guild members to them. <br><br>

                            Should the party choose to meet with them, the couple should attempt to befriend the party, especially since they are meant to be recurring characters. Fashum will drop a tidbit about there being work in another village, Midhauste, in the area that he was planning on heading out to. Should the party be interested,
                            he will allow them to do the work instead of him.
